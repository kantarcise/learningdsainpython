# All About Trees üå≥

Productivity experts say that breakthroughs come by thinking ‚Äúnon linearly.‚Äù

In this chapter, we discuss one of the most important nonlinear data structures in computing‚Äîtrees.

Tree structures are indeed a breakthrough in data organization, for **they allow us to implement a host of algorithms much faster than when using linear data structures**, such as array-based lists or linked lists.

Trees also provide a natural organization for data, and consequently have become ubiquitous structures in file systems, graphical user interfaces, databases, Web sites, and other computer systems.

## General Trees

The relationships in a tree are hierarchical, with some objects being ‚Äúabove‚Äù and some ‚Äúbelow‚Äù others.

### Tree Definitions and Properties

A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically. 

With the exception of the top element, each element in a tree has a **parent** element and zero or more **children** elements.

We typically call the top element the root of the tree, but it is drawn as the highest element, with the other elements being connected below (just the opposite of a botanical tree).

#### Other Node Relationships - Internal External

Two nodes that are children of the same parent are **siblings**. 

A node v is **external** if v has ==no children==.  A node v is **internal** if it has one or more children. 

External nodes are also known as **leaves**.

We discussed the hierarchical relationship between files and directories in a computer‚Äôs file system, although at the time we did not emphasize the nomenclature of a file system as a tree. 

Now we revisit an earlier example. We see that the internal nodes of the tree are associated with directories and the leaves are associated with regular files. 

In the UNIX and Linux operating systems, the root of the tree is appropriately called the ‚Äúroot directory,‚Äù and is represented by the symbol ‚Äú/.‚Äù

#### ancestor - descendant

A node u is an ancestor of a node v if u = v or u is an ancestor of the parent of v. Conversely, we say that a node v is a descendant of a node u if u is an ancestor of v. 

For example, in Figure 8.3, `cs252/` is an ancestor of `papers/`, and `pr3` is a descendant of `cs016/`. 

The sub tree of T rooted at a node v is the tree consisting of all the descendants of v in T (including v itself). 

In Figure 8.3, the sub tree rooted at `cs016/` consists of the nodes `cs016/`, `grades`, `homeworks/`, `programs/`, `hw1`, `hw2`, `hw3`, `pr1`, `pr2`, and `pr3`.

#### Edges and Paths in Trees

**==An edge==** of tree T is a pair of nodes (u, v) such that u is the parent of v, or vice versa. 

**==A path==** of T is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in the sequence form an edge. 

For example, the tree in Figure 8.3 contains the path (`cs252/`, `projects/`, `demos/`, `market`).

The inheritance relation between classes in a Python program forms a tree when single inheritance is used. For example, in Chapter 2.4 we provided a summary of the hierarchy for Python‚Äôs exception types, as portrayed in Figure 8.4.

The `BaseException` class is the root of that hierarchy, while all user-defined exception classes should conventionally be declared as descendants of the more specific Exception class.

![[fig8.4.png]]

**Wisdom:**

In Python, all classes are organized into a single hierarchy, as there exists a built-in class named `object` as the ultimate base class.

It is a direct or indirect base class of all other types in Python (even if not declared as such when defining a new class). Therefore, the hierarchy pictured in Figure 8.4 is only a portion of Python‚Äôs complete class hierarchy.

As a preview of the remainder of this chapter, Figure 8.5 portrays our own hierarchy of classes for representing various forms of a tree.

![[fig8.5.png]]

#### Ordered Trees

A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each node; that is, we purposefully identify the children of a node as being the first, second, third, and so on. Such an order is usually visualized by arranging siblings left to right, according to their order.

A book, are hierarchically organized as a tree whose internal nodes are parts, chapters, and sections, and whose leaves are paragraphs, tables, figures, and so on.

![[fig8.6.png]]

### The Tree Abstract Data Type

An element is stored at each position, and positions satisfy parent-child relationships that define the tree structure. A position object for a tree supports the method:

**p.element():** Return the element stored at position p.

The tree ADT then supports the following accessor methods, allowing a user to navigate the various positions of a tree:

| Method |  Explained|
| ---- | ---- |
| `T.root()` | Return the position of the root of tree T, or None if T is empty. |
| `T.is_root(p)`  | Return `True` if position p is the root of Tree T. |
| `T.parent(p)`  | Return the position of the parent of position p, or None if p is the root of T. | 
| `T.num_children(p)`  | Return the number of children of position p. |
| `T.children(p)` | Generate an iteration of the children of position p. | 
| `T.is_leaf(p)` |  Return `True` if position p does not have any children. | 
| `len(T)` | Return the number of positions (and hence elements) that are contained in tree T. | 
| `T.is_empty()` | Return `True` if tree T does not contain any positions. | 
| `T.positions()` | Generate an iteration of all positions of tree T. | 
| `iter(T)` | Generate an iteration of all elements stored within tree  T. | 

If a tree T is ordered, then `T.children(p)` reports the children of p in the natural order. If `p` is a leaf, then `T.children(p)` generates an empty iteration. In similar regard, if tree T is empty, then both `T.positions( )` and `iter(T)` generate empty iterations.

### A Tree Abstract Base Class in Python

In discussing the object-oriented design principle of abstraction in Chapter 2, we noted that a public interface for an abstract data type is often managed in Python via duck typing. 

For example, we defined the notion of the public interface for a queue ADT in Chapter 6, and have since presented several classes that implement the queue interface (e.g., `ArrayQueue` in Chapter 6, `LinkedQueue` and `CircularQueue` in Chapter 7). 

However, we never gave any formal definition of the queue ADT in Python; all of the concrete implementations were self-contained classes that just happen to adhere to the same public interface. 

A more formal mechanism to designate the relationships between different implementations of the same abstraction is through the definition of one class that serves as an abstract base class, via inheritance, for one or more concrete classes.

We choose to define a `Tree` class, that serves as an abstract base class corresponding to the tree ADT.

Our reason for doing so is that there is quite a bit of useful code that we can provide, even at this level of abstraction, allowing greater code reuse in the concrete tree implementations we later define.

Although the `Tree` class is an abstract base class, it includes several concrete methods with implementations that rely on calls to the abstract methods of the class.

We note that, with the `Tree` class being abstract, there is no reason to create a direct instance of it, nor would such an instance be useful. The class exists to serve as a base for inheritance, and users will create instances of concrete subclasses.

Here is the code:

```python
class Tree:
    """Abstract base class representing a tree structure"""
    # nested Position class
    class Position:
        """An abstraction representing the location of a single element"""
        def element(self):
            """Return the element stored in this position"""
            raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented")

        def __eq__(self,other) -> bool:
            """Return true if other Position represents the same location"""
            raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented")

        def __ne__(self,other) -> bool:
            """Return True if other Position does not represent the same location"""
            return not(self == other)

    # ------ abstract methods that concrete subclass must support ------
    def root(self):
        """Return Position representing the trees root (None if empty)"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass")

    def parent(self, p):
        """Return position representing p's parent (None if p is root)"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass")

    def num_children(self, p):
        """Return the number of children that Position p has"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass")


    def children(self):
        """Generate an iteration of Positions representing p's children"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass")

    def __len__(self):
        """Return total number of elements in the tree"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass")

    # --------- concrete methods implemented in this class ------------
    
    def is_root(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p represents the root of the tree."""
        return self.root() == p

    def is_leaf(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p has no children"""
        return self.num_children(p) == 0

    def is_empty(self):
        """Return True if the tree is Empty"""
        return len(self) == 0
```

### Computing Depth and Height

Let p be the position of a node of a tree T. The **depth** of p is the number of ancestors of p, excluding p itself. 

Note that this definition implies that the depth of the root of T is 0.

Here is an approach for our Trees:

```python
def depth(self, p):
	"""Return the number of levels separating Position p from the root."""
	if self.is_root(p):
		return 0
	else:
		return 1 + self.depth(self.parent(p))
```

The height of a position p in a tree T is also defined recursively:
	‚Ä¢ If p is a leaf, then the height of p is 0.
	‚Ä¢ Otherwise, the height of p is one more than the maximum of the heights of p‚Äôs children.

The height of a nonempty tree T is the height of the root of T. For example, the tree of Figure 8.2 has height **4**. In addition, height can also be viewed as follows. 

- The height of a nonempty tree T is equal to the maximum of the depths of its leaf positions.

Here is an approach for out trees, to get an idea:

```python
def _height2(self, p): 
	# time is linear in size of subtree
	"""Return the height of the subtree rooted at Position p."""
	if self.is_leaf(p):
		return 0
	else:
		return 1 + max(self._height2(c) for c in self.children(p))
```

The ability to compute heights of sub trees is beneficial, but a user might expect to be able to compute the height of the entire tree without explicitly designating the tree root.

```python
def height(self, p = None):
	"""Return the height of the subtree rooted at Position p.
	If p is None, return the height of the entire tree.
	"""
	if p is None:
		p = self.root()
	return self._height2(p)  # start height2 recursion
```

## Binary Trees üß†

2 CHILDREN AT MOST, LEFT OR RIGHT CHILD.

A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:
1. Every node has at most **two children**.
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a **left child** or a **right child**.
3. A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.

The subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node v is called a **left subtree** or **right subtree**, respectively, of v. 

A binary tree is ==**proper**== if each node has either zero or two children. Some people also refer to such trees as being **full binary trees**. 

Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children.

A binary tree that is not proper is ==**improper**==.
##### Wisdom: - Decision Trees

An important class of binary trees arises in contexts where we wish to represent a number of different outcomes that can result from answering a series of yes-or-no questions. Each internal node is associated with a question.

Starting at the root, we go to the left or right child of the current node, depending on whether the answer to the question is ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù With each decision, we follow an edge from a parent to a child, eventually tracing a path in the tree from the root to a leaf.

Such binary trees are known as **==decision trees==**, because a leaf position p in such a tree represents a decision of what to do if the questions associated with p‚Äôs ancestors are answered in a way that leads to p. 

A decision tree is a proper binary tree.

![[fig8.7.png]]

An arithmetic expression can be represented by a **binary tree** whose leaves are associated with variables or constants, and whose internal nodes are associated with one of the operators +, ‚àí, √ó , and /.

![[fig8.8.png]]

_An arithmetic expression tree is a proper binary tree, since each operator +, ‚àí, √ó, and / takes exactly two operands._
##  The Binary Tree Abstract Data Type

As an abstract data type, a binary tree is a specialization of a tree that supports three additional accessor methods:

| Method | Explained |
| ---- | ---- |
| `T.left(p)` | Return the position that represents the left child of p, or `None` if p has no left child. |
| `T.right(p)` | Return the position that represents the right child of p, or `None` if p has no right child. |
| `T.sibling(p)` | Return the position that represents the sibling of p, or `None` if p has no sibling. |
 
Just as `Tree` was defined as an abstract base class, we define a new `BinaryTree` class associated with the binary tree ADT. We rely on inheritance to define the `BinaryTree` class based upon the existing Tree class. 

However, our `BinaryTree` class remains abstract, as we still do not provide complete specifications for how such a structure will be represented internally, nor implementations for some necessary behaviors.

```python
class BinaryTree(Tree):
    """Abstract base class representing a binary tree structure."""
        # --------------------- additional abstract methods ---------------------
    def left(self, p): 
        """Return a Position representing p s left child.
        Return None if p does not have a left child.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError( "must be implemented by subclass" )
    def right(self, p): 
        """Return a Position representing p s right child.
        Return None if p does not have a right child.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError(" must be implemented by subclass ")
    # ---------- concrete methods implemented in this class ----------
    def sibling(self, p): 
        """Return a Position representing p s sibling (or None if no sibling)."""
        parent = self.parent(p)
        if parent is None: # p must be the root 
            return None # root has no sibling
        else:
            if p == self.left(parent):
                return self.right(parent) # possibly None
            else:
                return self.left(parent) # possibly None
    
    def children(self, p): 
        """Generate an iteration of Positions representing p s children."""
		# whichever child exists, yield it.
        if self.left(p) is not None:
            yield self.left(p)
        if self.right(p) is not None:
            yield self.right(p)
```

By using inheritance, a binary tree supports all the functionality that was defined for general trees (e.g., `parent`, `is_leaf,` `root`).
## Properties of Binary Trees üòç

Binary trees have several interesting properties dealing with relationships between their heights and number of nodes.

We denote the set of all nodes of a tree T at the same depth $d$ as level d of T. In a binary tree, level $0$ has at most one node (the root), level $1$ has at most two nodes (the children of the root), level $2$ has at most four nodes, and so on. (See Figure 8.9.) In general, level $d$ has at most $2^d$ nodes.

![[fig8.9.png]]

_In a nonempty proper binary tree T , with $n_E$ external nodes and $n_I$ internal nodes, we have $n_E = n_I + 1$._

![[fig8.10.png]]

_At the start, we have 5 external and 4 internal. In the end, we have 4 external and 3 internal._

## Implementing Trees ü•∞ 

The `Tree` and `BinaryTree` classes that we have defined thus far in this chapter are both formally abstract base classes. 

Although they provide a great deal of support, neither of them can be directly instantiated.

There are several choices for the internal representation of trees. We describe the most common representations in this section. We begin with the case of a binary tree, since its shape is more narrowly defined.
## Linked Structure for Binary Trees

A natural way to realize a binary tree T is to use a linked structure, with a node that maintains references to the element stored at a position p and to the nodes associated with the children and parent of p. 

If p is the root of T , then the parent field of p is `None`. Likewise, if p does not have a left child (respectively, right child), the associated field is `None`. The tree itself maintains an instance variable storing a reference to the root node (if any), and a variable, called `size`, that represents the overall number of nodes of T.

![[fig8.11.png]]

For the implementation,  we define a simple, nonpublic `Node` class to represent a node, and a public `Position` class that wraps a node. We provide a validate utility for robustly checking the validity of a given position instance when unwrapping it, and a make position utility for wrapping a node as a position to return to a caller.

For linked binary trees, a reasonable set of update methods to support for general usage are the following:

**`T.add_root(e)`:** Create a root for an empty tree, storing e as the element, and return the position of that root; an error occurs if the tree is not empty.

**`T.add_left(p, e)`:** Create a new node storing element e, link the node as the left child of position p, and return the resulting position; an error occurs if p already has a left child.

**`T.add_right(p, e)`:** Create a new node storing element e, link the node as the right child of position p, and return the resulting position; an error occurs if p already has a right child.

**`T.replace(p, e)`:** Replace the element stored at position p with element e, and return the previously stored element. 

**`T.delete(p)`:** Remove the node at position p, replacing it with its child, if any, and return the element that had been stored at p; an error occurs if p has two children.

**`T.attach(p, T1, T2)`:** Attach the internal structure of trees T1 and T2, respectively, as the left and right sub trees of leaf position p of T, and reset T1 and T2 to empty trees; an error condition occurs if p is not a leaf.

We have specifically chosen this collection of operations because each can be implemented in $O(1)$ worst-case time with our linked representation.

This is going to be a long one. Get ready. Here is the code:

### Performance of the Linked Binary Tree Implementation

Here is how they look:

| Method | Running Time |
| - | - |
| `len`, `is_empty` | $O(1)$ | 
| `root`, `parent`, `left`, `right`, `sibling`, `children`, `num_children` | $O(1)$ |  
| `is_root`, `is_leaf` |  $O(1)$ |
| `depth(p)` |  $O(d_p + 1)$
| `height` | $O(n)$ | 
| `add_root`, `add_left`, `add_right`, `replace`, `delete`, `attach` | $O(1)$ | 
## Array-Based Representation of a Binary Tree üíï

An alternative representation of a binary tree T is based on a way of numbering the positions of T . For every position p of T , let $f(p)$ be the integer defined as follows.

‚Ä¢ If p is the root of T , then $f (p) = 0$.
‚Ä¢ If p is the left child of position q, then $f (p) = 2 f (q) + 1$.
‚Ä¢ If p is the right child of position q, then $f (p) = 2 f (q) + 2$.

The numbering function $f$ is known as a level numbering of the positions in a binary tree T, for it numbers the positions on each level of T in increasing order from left to right.

Note well that the level numbering is based on potential positions within the tree, not actual positions of a given tree, so they are not necessarily consecutive.

![[fig8.12.png]]

The level numbering function f suggests a representation of a binary tree T  by means of an array-based structure A (such as a Python `list`), with the element at position p of T stored at index $f (p)$ of the array.

![[fig8.13.png]]

One advantage of an array-based representation of a binary tree is that a position p can be represented by the single integer $f(p)$, and that position-based methods such as `root`, `parent`, `left`, and `right` can be implemented using simple arithmetic operations on the number $f(p)$.

Based on our formula for the level numbering, the left child of p has index $2 f(p) + 1$, the right child of p has index $2 f (p) + 2$, and the parent of p has index $‚åä(f (p) ‚àí 1)/2‚åã$. 

Reminder: The notation ‚åàx‚åâ represents the **ceiling** of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. The notation ‚åäx‚åã represents is the **floor** of x,  the largest integer less than or equal to x.  

The space usage of an array-based representation depends greatly on the shape of the tree. 

Let $n$ be the number of nodes of T , and let $f_M$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ over all the nodes of T. 

The array A requires length $N = 1 + f_M$ , since elements range from $A[0]$ to $A[f_M]$. Note that A may have a number of empty cells that do not refer to existing nodes of T. 

In fact, in the worst case, $N = 2^n ‚àí 1$. (==Half of it is empty!==) 

In Chapter 9, we will see a class of binary trees, called ‚Äú**heaps**‚Äù for which $N = n$. Thus, in spite of the worst-case space usage, there are applications for which the **array representation of a binary tree** is space efficient.

Still, for general binary trees, the exponential worst-case space requirement of this representation is prohibitive.

Another drawback of an array representation is that some update operations for trees cannot be efficiently supported. For example, deleting a node and promoting its child takes $O(n)$ time because it is not just the child that moves locations within the array, but all descendants of that child.
## Linked Structure for General Trees üòé

When representing a binary tree with a linked structure, each node explicitly maintains fields left and right as references to individual children. For a general tree, there is no a priori limit on the number of children that a node may have:

![[fig8.14.png]]

Here are the performances of the implementation of the general tree using a linked structure:

|Operation | Running Time|
| - | - |
| `len`, `is_empty` | O(1) | 
| `root`, `parent`, `is_root`, `is_leaf` | O(1) |
| `children(p)` | $O(c_p + 1)$ |
| `depth(p)` | $O(d_p + 1)$ |
| `height` | $O(n)$ |

## Tree Traversal Algorithms

A **traversal** of a tree T is a systematic way of accessing, or ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù all the positions of T. A lot of ways to traverse:
## Preorder and Postorder Traversals of General Trees

### Preorder Traversal - Reading a World Class Book üòâ (DFS)

YOU PREORDERED A BOOK - YOU ARE CURIOUS - YOU READ IT ALL.

In a preorder traversal of a tree T , the root of T is visited first and then the sub trees rooted at its children are traversed recursively. If the tree is ordered, then the subtrees are traversed according to the order of the children.

![[fig8.15.png]]

Here is DFS in the wild:

```markdown
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth 
smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

**Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
**Output:** 1

**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is¬†`n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
```

Solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
	def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        
        temp = []         
        
        def dfs(root):        
            if not root:
                return   
            # go to left subtree until we find a single node         
            dfs(root.left)
            if len(temp) == k:
                return
            temp.append(root.val)            
            dfs(root.right)
        
        dfs(root)

        # last element of temp is the node we want
        return temp[-1]
```

#### Postorder Traversal - See the Children Than Look at Parents (DFS)

JUST POST IT MAN IDC GIVE ME DETAILS ASAP

In some sense, this algorithm can be viewed as the opposite of the preorder traversal, because it recursively traverses the subtrees rooted at the children of the root first, and then visits the root (hence, the name ‚Äúpostorder‚Äù).

![[fig8.16.png]]

##### Running-Time Analysis

Both preorder and postorder traversal algorithms are efficient ways to access all the positions of a tree.

The overall running time for the traversal of tree T is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of positions in the tree. This running time is asymptotically optimal since the traversal must visit all the $n$ positions of the tree.

### Breadth-First Tree Traversal - See Everyone At This Level Than Go Deeper üòç (BFS)

Another common approach is to traverse a tree so that we visit all the positions at depth `d` before we visit the positions at depth `d + 1`. Such an algorithm is known as a **breadth-first traversal**.

![[fig8.17.png]]
## Inorder Traversal of a Binary Tree - Swipe from Left -> Right (DFS)

During an inorder traversal, we visit a position between the recursive traversals of its left and right subtrees. 
 
The inorder traversal of a binary tree T can be informally viewed as visiting the nodes of T ‚Äúfrom left to right.‚Äù
 
![[fig8.18.png]]

_3 + 1 √ó 3/9 ‚àí 5 + 2 ..._

#### Binary Search Trees ü§î

An important application of the inorder traversal algorithm arises when we store an ordered sequence of elements in a binary tree, defining a structure we call a **binary search tree.**

Let S be a set whose unique elements have an order relation. For example, S could be a set of integers. A binary search tree for S is a binary tree T such that, for each position p of T :
‚Ä¢ Position p stores an element of S, denoted as e(p).
‚Ä¢ Elements stored in the left subtree of p (if any) are less than e(p).
‚Ä¢ Elements stored in the right subtree of p (if any) are greater than e(p).

![[fig8.19.png]]

A binary search tree can be viewed as a binary decision tree (recall Example 8.6), where the question asked at each internal node is whether the element at that node is less than, equal to, or larger than the element being searched for.

Chapter 11 is devoted to the study of search trees.

### Implementing Tree Traversals in Python

When first defining the tree ADT in Chapter 8.1.2, we stated that tree T should include support for the following methods:

`T.positions()`: Generate an iteration of all positions of tree T.
`iter(T)`: Generate an iteration of all elements stored within tree T.

At that time, we did not make any assumption about the order in which these iterations report their results. In this section, we demonstrate how any of the tree traversal algorithms we have introduced could be used to produce these iterations.

##### Preorder Traversal

Formally, both `preorder` and the utility `_subtree_preorder` are generators. Rather than perform a ‚Äúvisit‚Äù action from within this code, we yield each position to the caller and let the caller decide what action to perform at that position.

```python
def preorder(self):
	"""Generate a preorder iteration of positions in the tree."""
	if not self.is_empty():
		for p in self._subtree_preorder(self.root()): # start recursion
			yield p

def _subtree_preorder(self, p):
	"""Generate a preorder iteration of positions in subtree rooted at p."""
	yield p # visit p before its subtrees
	for c in self.children(p): # for each child c
		for other in self._subtree_preorder(c): # do preorder of c‚Äôs subtree
			yield other # yielding each to our caller
```

##### Postorder Traversal

We can implement a postorder traversal using very similar technique as with a preorder traversal. 

The only difference is that within the recursive utility for a post-order we wait to yield position p until after we have recursively yield the positions in its subtrees.

Children before parents!

```python
def postorder(self):
	"""Generate a postorder iteration of positions in the tree."""
	if not self.is_empty( ):
		for p in self._subtree_postorder(self.root( )): # start recursion
			yield p

def _subtree_postorder(self, p):
	"""Generate a postorder iteration of positions in subtree rooted at p."""
	for c in self.children(p): # for each child c
		for other in self._subtree_postorder(c): # do postorder of c‚Äôs subtree
			yield other   # yielding each to our caller
	yield p # visit p after its subtrees
```

##### Breadth First Traversal

We can use a `Queue` (A `LinkedQueue`) for this solution. Add the level to the root, and as you empty it add the children of those nodes in the current level.

```python
def breadthfirst(self):
	"""Generate a breadth-first iteration of the positions of the tree."""
	if not self.is_empty():
		fringe = LinkedQueue() # known positions not yet yielded
		fringe.enqueue(self.root()) # starting with the root
		while not fringe.is_empty():
			p = fringe.dequeue( ) # remove from front of the queue
			yield p # report this position
			for c in self.children(p):
				fringe.enqueue(c) # add children to back of queue
```

##### Inorder Traversal

The idea is cool. You traverse the left tree, you travel the parent than you travel the right tree.

```python
def inorder(self):
	"""Generate an inorder iteration of positions in the tree."""
	if not self.is_empty():
		for p in self._subtree_inorder(self.root()):
			yield p
			
def _subtree_inorder(self, p):
	"""Generate an inorder iteration of positions in subtree rooted at p."""
	if self.left(p) is not None:  # if left child exists, traverse its subtree
		for other in self._subtree_inorder(self.left(p)):
			yield other
	
	yield p  # visit p between its subtrees

	if self.right(p) is not None:  # if right child exists, traverse its subtree
		for other in self._subtree_inorder(self.right(p)):
			yield other
```

### Applications of Tree Traversals

**Wisdom:** Reading a book is preorder, filesystem is postorder, swipe from left to right is inorder.

Here are some examples for using the tree traversals we learned.

#### Table of Contents

When using a tree to represent the hierarchical structure of a document, a preorder traversal of the tree can naturally be used to produce a table of contents for the document.

![[fig8.20.png]]

_We indent each element with a number of spaces equal to twice the element‚Äôs depth in the tree_

```python
def preorder_label(T, p, d, path):
	"""Print labeled representation of subtree of T rooted at p at depth d."""
	label = ".".join(str(j+1) for j in path) # displayed labels are one-indexed
	print(2 * d * " " + label, p.element())
	path.append(0) # path entries are zero-indexed
	for c in T.children(p):
		preorder_label(T, c, d+1, path) # child depth is d+1
		path[‚àí1] += 1
	path.pop()
```
#### Parenthetic Representations of a Tree

It is not possible to reconstruct a general tree, given only the preorder sequence of elements.

Some additional context is necessary for the structure of the tree to be well defined. The use of indentation or numbered labels provides such context, with a very human-friendly presentation. However, there are more concise string representations of trees that are computer-friendly.

$$P(T ) = str(p.element()) + ( + P(T_1) + , + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + , + P(T_k ) + )$$
is where p is the root of T and $T_1$, $T_2$, . . . , $T_k$ are the subtrees rooted at the children of p, which are given in order if T is an ordered tree.

_The opening parenthesis must be produced just before the loop over a position‚Äôs children and the closing parenthesis must be produced just after that loop_:

```python
def parenthesize(T, p):
	"""Print parenthesized representation of subtree of T rooted at p."""
	print(p.element(), end='' )  # use of end avoids trailing newline
	if not T.is_leaf(p):
		first time = True
		for c in T.children(p):
			sep = ' (' if first time else ', '  # determine proper separator
			print(sep, end='')
			first time = False # any future passes will not be the first
			parenthesize(T, c)   # recur on child
		print(")" , end='') # include closing parenthesis
```

#### Computing Disk Space

The recursive computation of disk space is emblematic of a postorder traversal,as we cannot effectively compute the total space used by a directory until after we know the space that is used by its children directories.

```python
def disk_space(T, p):
	"""Return total disk space for subtree of T rooted at p."""
	subtotal = p.element().space()  # space used at position p
	for c in T.children(p):
		subtotal += disk space(T, c)  # add child‚Äôs space to subtotal
	return subtotal
```

### Euler Tours and the Template Method Pattern ü§î

Unfortunately, they also show that the specific implementations of the preorder and postorder methods of our Tree class, or the inorder method of the `BinaryTree` class, are not general enough to capture the range of computations we desire. 

In some cases, we need more of a blending of the approaches, with initial work performed before recurring on subtrees, additional work performed after those recursions, and in the case of a binary tree, work performed between the two possible recursions. Furthermore, in some contexts it was important to know the depth of a position, or the complete path from the root to that position, or to return information from one level of the recursion to another.

In this section, we develop a more general framework for implementing tree traversals based on a concept known as an **Euler Tour traversal**. ==The Euler Tour traversal of a general tree T can be informally defined as a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù around T, where we start by going from the root toward its leftmost child, viewing the edges of T as being ‚Äúwalls‚Äù that we always keep to our left.==

Euler tour: We walk around hugging an invisible walk around tree. 

![[fig8.21.png]]

The complexity of the walk is $O(n)$, because it progresses exactly two times along each of the $n‚àí1$ edges of the tree‚Äîonce going downward along the edge, and later going upward along the edge.

Here is the code:

```python
class EulerTour:
    """
    Abstract base class for performing Euler tour of a tree.
    _hook_previsit and _hook_postvisit may be overridden by subclasses.
    """
    
    def __init__ (self, tree):
        """Prepare an Euler tour template for given tree."""
        self._tree = tree
    
    def tree(self):
        """Return reference to the tree being traversed."""
        return self._tree
   
    def execute(self):
        """Perform the tour and return any result from post visit of root."""
        if len(self._tree) > 0:
            return self._tour(self._tree.root(), 0, []) # start the recursion
   
    def tour(self, p, d, path): 
        """Perform tour of subtree rooted at Position p.
    
        p Position of current node being visited
        d depth of p in the tree 
        
        path list of indices of children on path from root to p
        
        """
        self._hook_previsit(p, d, path) # ‚Äùpre visit‚Äù p
        results = []
        path.append(0) # add new index to end of path before recursion
        for c in self._tree.children(p):
            results.append(self._tour(c, d+1, path)) # recur on child s subtree
            path[-1] += 1 # increment index
        path.pop() # remove extraneous index from end of path
        answer = self._hook_postvisit(p, d, path, results) # ‚Äùpost visit‚Äù p
        return answer
   
    def _hook_previsit(self, p, d, path): # can be overridden
        pass
   
    def _hook_postvisit(self, p, d, path, results): # can be overridden
        pass
```

Formally, our framework relies on the following two hooks that can be specialized:

‚Ä¢ `_hook_previsit(p, d, path)`: This function is called once for each position, immediately before its subtrees (if any) are traversed. Parameter p is a position in the tree, d is the depth of that position, and path is a list of indices, using the convention described in the discussion of Code Fragment 8.24. No return value is expected from this function.

‚Ä¢ `_hook_postvisit(p, d, path, results)`: This function is called once for each position, immediately after its subtrees (if any) are traversed. The first three parameters use the same convention as did hook previsit. The final parameter is a list of objects that were provided as return values from the post visits of the respective subtrees of p. Any value returned by this call will be available to the parent of p during its postvisit.

#### Using Euler Tour

Here is a simplification for the indented printing with numbers problem:

```python
class PreorderPrintIndentedLabeledTour(EulerTour):
	def _hook_previsit(self, p, d, path):
		label = ".".join(str(j+1) for j in path) # labels are one-indexed
		print(2 * d * " " + label, p.element())
```

Or disk space problem:

```python
class DiskSpaceTour(EulerTour):
	def _hook_postvisit(self, p, d, path, results):
		# we simply add space associated with p to that of its subtrees
		return p.element().space() + sum(results)
```

#### The Euler Tour Traversal of a Binary Tree

We introduced the concept of an Euler Tour traversal of a general graph, using the template method pattern in designing the `EulerTour` class. That class provided methods hook previsit and hook postvisit that could be overridden to customize a tour. 

Down below we provide a `BinaryEulerTour` specialization that includes an additional hook invisit that is called once for each position‚Äîafter its left subtree is traversed, but before its right subtree is traversed.

```python
class BinaryEulerTour(EulerTour):
    """Abstract base class for performing Euler tour of a binary tree.
    This version includes an additional _hook_invisit that is called after the tour
    of the left subtree (if any), yet before the tour of the right subtree (if any).
    Note: Right child is always assigned index 1 in path, even if no left sibling.
    """

    def _tour(self, p, d, path):
        results = [None, None]  # will update with results of recursions
        self._hook_previsit(p, d, path)  # "pre visit" for p
        if self._tree.left(p) is not None:  # consider left child
            path.append(0)
            results[0] = self._tour(self._tree.left(p), d + 1, path)
            path.pop()
        self._hook_invisit(p, d, path)  # "in visit" for p
        if self._tree.right(p) is not None:  # consider right child
            path.append(1)
            results[1] = self._tour(self._tree.right(p), d + 1, path)
            path.pop()
        answer = self._hook_postvisit(p, d, path, results)  # "post visit" p
        return answer

    def _hook_invisit(self, p, d, path):
        """Visit Position p, between tour of its left and right subtrees."""
        pass
```

We can use this class when we want to draw a graphical layout for a tree:

![[fig8.22.png]]

The geometry is determined by an algorithm that assigns x- and y-coordinates to each position p of a binary tree T using the following two rules:
‚Ä¢ x(p) is the number of positions visited before p in an inorder traversal of T .
‚Ä¢ y(p) is the depth of p in T .
In this application, we take the convention common in computer graphics that x - coordinates increase left to right and y - coordinates increase top to bottom. So the origin is in the upper left corner of the computer screen.

```python
class BinaryLayout(BinaryEulerTour):
    """Class for computing (x,y) coordinates for each node of a binary tree."""

    def __init__(self, tree):
        super().__init__(tree)  # must call the parent constructor
        self._count = 0  # initialize count of processed nodes

    def _hook_invisit(self, p, d, path):
        p.element().setX(self._count)  # x-coordinate serialized by count
        p.element().setY(d)  # y-coordinate is depth
        self._count += 1  # advance count of processed nodes
```

## Case Study: An Expression Tree

In this section, we define a new `ExpressionTree` class that provides support for constructing such trees, and for displaying and evaluating the arithmetic expression that such a tree represents. Our `ExpressionTree` class is defined as a subclass of `LinkedBinaryTree`, and we rely on the nonpublic mutators to construct such trees. Each internal node must store a string that defines a binary operator (e.g., + ), and each leaf must store a numeric value (or a string representing a numeric value).

Our eventual goal is to build arbitrarily complex expression trees for compound arithmetic expressions such as $(((3 + 1) √ó 4)/((9 ‚àí 5) + 2))$. 

```python
class ExpressionTree(LinkedBinaryTree):
    """An arithmetic expression tree."""

    def __init__(self, token, left=None, right=None):
        """Create an expression tree.
        In a single parameter form, token should be a leaf value (e.g., '42'),
        and the expression tree will have that value at an isolated node.
        In a three-parameter version, token should be an operator,
        and left and right should be existing ExpressionTree instances
        that become the operands for the binary operator.
        """
        super().__init__()  # LinkedBinaryTree initialization
        if not isinstance(token, str):
            raise TypeError('Token must be a string')
        self._add_root(token)  # use inherited, nonpublic method
        if left is not None:  # presumably three-parameter form
            if token not in '+-*x/':
                raise ValueError('token must be valid operator')
            self._attach(self.root(), left, right)  # use inherited, nonpublic method

    def __str__(self):
        """Return string representation of the expression."""
        pieces = []  # sequence of piecewise strings to compose
        self._parenthesize_recur(self.root(), pieces)
        return ''.join(pieces)

    def _parenthesize_recur(self, p, result):
        """Append piecewise representation of p's subtree to resulting list."""
        if self.is_leaf(p):
            result.append(str(p.element()))  # leaf value as a string
        else:
            result.append('(')  # opening parenthesis
            self._parenthesize_recur(self.left(p), result)  # left subtree
            result.append(p.element())  # operator
            self._parenthesize_recur(self.right(p), result)  # right subtree
            result.append(')')  # closing parenthesis

    def evaluate(self):
        """Return the numeric result of the expression."""
        return self._evaluate_recur(self.root())

    def _evaluate_recur(self, p):

Using a stack, we can build an expression tree:

```python
def build_expression_tree(tokens):
    """Returns an ExpressionTree based upon by a tokenized expression.
    tokens must be an iterable of strings representing a fully parenthesized
    binary expression, such as ['(', '43', '-', '(', '3', '*', '10', ')', ')']
    """
    S = []  # we use Python list as stack
    for t in tokens:
        if t in '+-x*/':  # t is an operator symbol
            S.append(t)  # push the operator symbol
        elif t not in '()':  # consider t to be a literal
            S.append(ExpressionTree(t))  # push trivial tree storing value
        elif t == ')':  # compose a new tree from three constituent parts
            right = S.pop()  # right subtree as per LIFO
            op = S.pop()  # operator symbol
            left = S.pop()  # left subtree
            S.append(ExpressionTree(op, left, right))  # repush tree
            # we ignore a left parenthesis
    return S.pop()
```

Done with third version. üíï
