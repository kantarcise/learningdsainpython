This repository is about the brown book - [Data Structures and Algorithms - In Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275). ðŸ¥³

This is the **key** book where I started to take [this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC82Il2cjqA) seriously.

It changed my life.

I strongly encourage you to buy the book but you can read it online, thanks to **NIBM digital library** [here](https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Python.pdf).

The book consists of 15 Chapters.

This website is my rewriting of the book.

Subjectively, it's more fun. Because it's written for students by a novice student. ðŸ¥°

Go ahead, take a look at the [first chapter and see for yourself](https://learningdsainpython.kantarcise.com/DS%26A-PythonPrimer/). ðŸ’•
